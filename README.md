**Description:**  
In a pitch-black void, a tiny flame flickers weakly, clinging to life. Its only hope is to feed on what little it can findâ€”small, scattered objects hidden in the darkness.

**Notes:**  
- The flame is fragile.  
- Look carefully for items to feed it.  
- As it dims, questions will rise.  
- Will you burn brightly or let the void swallow you whole?
